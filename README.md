🆔 About GUID
This project uses GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) as primary keys for branches, moving beyond simple integers.
What is a GUID?

Example: 3f2504e0-4f89-11d3-9a0c-0305e82c3301  
A 128-bit unique identifier to prevent ID collisions  
Perfect for distributed systems requiring uniqueness

Why Use It?

Security: Harder for attackers to guess records  
Scalability: Ensures unique IDs across environments

Example Usage
Fetch a branch with:GET /api/branches/3f2504e0-4f89-11d3-9a0c-0305e82c3301The API maps this GUID to the corresponding branch in the database.

📦 Example Branch Object
{
  "name": "Main City Branch",
  "location": "123 Main St, Anytown",
  "contactNumber": "0401234567",
  "managerName": "Jane Doe"
}
